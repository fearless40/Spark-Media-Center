# Spark-Media-Center
A fan controller and possible light controller written for my spark core. 

Currently a very simple device to control the fans in my media center. 
Uses a fan controller logic that works based off of the slope change of the
temperature. Currently using simulated temperatures so not totally sure 
how well it will work once it is installed. 

The final project will use 4 fans with 2 in a push-pull config and the other
2 in a pull config only.
